# `eslint-plugin-simple-header`

Simple to use license header plugin for ESLint.

## Installation

Add the following url as a dev dependency using your package manager (`pnpm add -D` or `yarn`, `npm` etc):

    git+https://codeberg.org/dissoc/eslint-plugin-simple-header.git

## Usage

Given the following configuration:

``` json
{
    "plugins": ["simple-header"],
    "rules": {
        "simple-header/header": [
            "error",
            [
                "Caterpillar, meow",
                "Copyright (c) {year} {author}",
                "",
                "SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0"
            ],
            { "templates": { "author": [".*", "cat"] } }
        ]
    }
}
```

The rule will match a header like this:

    /*
     * Caterpillar, meow
     * Copyright (c) 2023 Anyone
     *
     * SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
     */

And when running auto-fix, will insert a header like so:

    /*
     * Caterpillar, meow
     * Copyright (c) 2023 cat
     *
     * SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
     */

(Where 2023 is the current year, if you are from the future)

See the section below for more info on `templates`.

If a header is already present when running auto-fix, it will be replaced (note that JSDoc comments are still kept).
Additionally, the rule will still match the header if it starts with `/*!` instead of `/*`, which in many tools
indicates that the comment should not be removed (e.g.Â in bundlers like
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#legal-comments)).

## `header` options

The `simple-header/header` rule takes a string option and an object option:

String option:

- (required) Header text. This may be a string, or an array of strings, which will be joined by newlines (this is
  convenient for JSON configs)

Object option:

- `"templates"` configures what templates can be used in the header. It should be an object whose properties are tuples
  of `[pattern, default]`. When a template is used in the header (`{foo}`), the rule will accept any headers which match
  `pattern`, and when inserting headers via auto-fix, `default` will be used. By default, this includes `year`, which
  matches any four digit string and defaults to the current year.

- `"newlines"` how many blank lines should be added after the block comment (defaults to `1`)

- `"plain": false` automatically prefixes comment lines with asterisks, and adds leading whitespace: (this is the
  default)

      /*
       * A single line will be formatted like this.
       */

- `"plain": true` uses the header text as-is in the block comment
